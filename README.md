Andela Teams seeks to automate some of the routine actions taken by __simulations learning facilitators__ at Andela.

Here is a useful scenario. When a new cohort (class) begins simulations (*sims*) at Andela, the cohort is broken into teams, and each team is assigned to a learning facilitator. The learning facilitator then creates a few Slack channels, a Github repo, and a Pivotal Tracker board. For each of these, the facilitator has to add every member of the team to the channel/repo/board. This is obviously a task that should be automated, especially considering that even the names of the channels/repo/board are always in a particular format. Andela Teams seeks to automate these and many more routine tasks performed by facilitators.
